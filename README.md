# ðŸ¥– AGAPAN â€“ Artisan Bakery Website

Live Demo ðŸ‘‰ [https://agapan-website.vercel.app](https://agapan-website.vercel.app)

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
AGAPAN is an artisan bakery website built with **Next.js 15, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript**.  
This project is not just a demo â€” **I use it daily for my personal bakery brand** to showcase products, receive orders via WhatsApp, and connect with my customers.  
It is directly linked to my **social media**, bringing real traffic and benefits to my business.

This makes AGAPAN both a **portfolio project** and a **real-world working application**, proving my ability to create software that delivers value in everyday use.
