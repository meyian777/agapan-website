# 🥖 AGAPAN – Artisan Bakery Website

Live Demo 👉 [https://agapan-website.vercel.app](https://agapan-website.vercel.app)

---

## 📌 About the Project
AGAPAN is an artisan bakery website built with **Next.js 15, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript**.  
This is not just a demo — I use it **daily for my bakery brand** to showcase products, receive orders via WhatsApp, and connect with customers.  
It is also linked to my **social media profiles**, showing that this project provides **real business value**.  

This makes AGAPAN both a **portfolio project** and a **live production website**.
